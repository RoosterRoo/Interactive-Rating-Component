## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to:

- create a pill button
- how to create a circular div without an image inside. Although I feel there could be a better way to do this

### Continued development

I will be implementing the optimisations provided by my fellow community members

### Useful resources

- [Tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-create-pill-buttons-with-css) - This helped me to create the pill button. I will use it going forward for similar designs.
